			[Intro]
			<br>I used to live out west in a collective
			<br>I used to, yeah</p>
			
			<p>
			[Verse 1]
			<br>We used to live out west in a collective
			<br>Everybody got arrested 'cause nobody wanted sleep
			<br>I used to dish out verses on purpose
			<br>And if you wanted to purchase one you weren't as good as me
			<br>I don't know if that time is comin' to an end
			<br>I hope the band gets back together when it's over</p>
			
			<p>
			[Chorus]
			<br>Don't you go runnin' for the hills
			<br>You can't outrun it by yourself
			<br>By yourself</p>
			<p>
	
			[Verse 2]
			<br>And when I call you up, you barely answer
			<br>You think you got it all figured out
			<br>You act like you don't even remember
			<br>Oh, you're all by yourself
			</p>

			<p>
			[Chorus]
			<br>Don't you go runnin' for the hills
			<br>You can't outrun it by yourself
			<br>By yourself</p>
