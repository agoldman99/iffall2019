	<h1> Feedback for Arthur </h1>
	<h3> Feedback given by Arianna </h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Pictures are slightly pixelated — maybe you can find higher quality images? </li>
		<li>Could apply different effects to quote and the names? Size of name could be decreased? “Kenobi” should be capitalized. </li>
		<li>I wonder if there is a different typeface that fits “Starwars” a bit better -- Starwars has a very specific visual voice, maybe you could tap into that?</li>
		<li>It is very clear and easy to read!</li>
		<li>Transition between desktop to mobile seems clear and smooth</li>
		<li>Add in the black bars on the top and bottom in the Anakin Skywalker postcard like you have for the other two</li>
	</ol>
