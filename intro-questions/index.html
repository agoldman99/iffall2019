		<br><ol>Introductory Questions</br>
				<br><li>My name is Arianna Goldman and I am a junior majoring in communication design and minoring in Chinese.</li></br>

				<br><li>Although I am taking this class as a part of my major requirements, I am really interested in UX/UI design so am very excited for this class. </li></br>

				<br><li>I have no experience in HTML/CSS/JS.</li></br>

				<br><li>I hope to gain enough skills where I feel comfortable working in HTML/CSS and learn how to effectively communicate on a screen.</li></br>

				<br><li>Designing for a screen involves more interactive visual storytelling often with motion, while designing for paper can be more static. </li></br>

				<br><li>A website that exemplifies effective design: <a href=" ">https://www.x.company/ </a>
					This website introduces new information as the user scrolls down, keeping them interested. They also use interesting visuals and typography to clearly express their message and projects.</li></br>

				<br><li>A website that exemplifies effective communication: <a href=" "> https://darksky.net/forecast/40.7127,-74.0059/us12/en </a>
				Dark Sky's website effectively communicates the weather in specific locations. By simplifying complicated weather maps and introducing clear icons and charts, it provides a very user-friendly interface.</li></br>

				<br><li>A website that works well: <a href=" ">https://www.airbnb.com </a>
					This website works well because it effectively combines clear communication with engaging design. It also makes it very easy for the user to interact with the website and truly explore a variety of options. This is offered through a variety of search and "explore" options that the website offers.</br>
